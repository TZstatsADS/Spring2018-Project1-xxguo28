# Project: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

There are a R Markdown file and a html file which show my final report.

Also, I add a pdf file here, but this file is not as good-looking as nb.html file. I just use it to show the plots in my report.
