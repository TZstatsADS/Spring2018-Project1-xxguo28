### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: What does the trend of U.S. presidents’ inaugrual speeches reflect?
+ This project is conducted by [Xiaoxiao Guo (xg2282)]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] The main question of this research is to analyse the trend of presidents’ inaugrual speeches according to the 58 inaugrual speeches we have from 1789-2017 and think about what these changes reflect. Specifically, I want to tell a story from the following three aspects:

Change in length of sentences in presidents’ inaugrual speeches
Change in speakers’ emotions with presidents’ inaugrual speeches
Change in topics of presidents’ inaugrual speeches
